# Lazy loading of images in HTML5 example

## Purpose
Example of HTML's lazy loading of images

## Instructions
1. Open the page in a web browser.
2. Open the browser web developer tools.
3. Check out the messages in the console. They show whether the first and last images have loaded right after the DOM has been fully loaded, and then a second later.
4. Go to the "Network" tab.
5. Check "Disable cache".
6. To simulate poor network connections, use different throttling values (next to "Disable cache") and refresh the page by typing Ctrl+R. Notice how the image loading status changes.

## Tools
JavaScript / HTML5
